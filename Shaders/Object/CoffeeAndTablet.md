A great shader, in which I have built in a lot of parameters. So the texture of the cup, the tablet and the bottom can be adjusted. The spotlight can change color and position. Reflection, fog, reflections, light and spotlights can be switched off. The position of the cup and tablet can be changed and finally the tablet can be rotated across all levels.

Have fun

### Description of the Shader in Shadertoy:
Use the mouse to rotate.
I wanted to combine some raymarching with interesting materials and lighting.
Based on the textureless version here: http://glsl.heroku.com/e#6171.0
