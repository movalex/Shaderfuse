A look into the past. You'd think it was ages ago, but the VT220 was manufactured and sold from 1983 to 1987.

### Description of the Shader in Shadertoy:
Using original vt220 font (https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs).
Use mouse to adjust screen curvature and position.
The implementation of full vt100 terminal emulation in GLSL is left as an exercise for the reader.
